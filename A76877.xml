            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> KING is a Mortall God on Earth, unto whom the living God ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â¢</desc>
               </gap>h lent his owne Name as a great honour; but withall told him he Å¿hould dy like a Man, leÅ¿t he Å¿hould be proud and flatter himÅ¿elf? That God hath with his Name, imparted unto him his Nature alÅ¿o.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of all kind of Men, God is leaÅ¿t beholding unto them, for He doth moÅ¿t for Them, and they do ordinarily leaÅ¿t for Him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A King that would not feele his Crown too heavy for him, muÅ¿t wear it every day; but if he think it to light, he knoweth not of what mettal it is made of.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:161455:3"/>
            <p n="4">4. He muÅ¿t make Religion the Rule of Government, and not the Ballance the Scale; for he that caÅ¿teth in Religion only to make the Scales even, his own weight is contained in theÅ¿e Characters, <hi>Tekel uphraÅ¿in,</hi> he is found too light, his Kingdom Å¿hall be taken from him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And that King that holds not Religion the beÅ¿t reaÅ¿on of State, is void of all Piety and JuÅ¿tice, the Supporters of a King.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He muÅ¿t be able to give Councell himÅ¿elf, but not to rely thereupon; for though happy Events juÅ¿tifie their Councels, yet it is better, that the evill event of good advice be rather imputed to a Subject, then a Soveraign.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He is the Fountain of Honour, which Å¿hould not runne with a waÅ¿t Pipe, leaÅ¿t the Courtiers Å¿ell the Waters, and then (as PapiÅ¿ts Å¿ay of their Holy Wels) to loÅ¿e the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He is the life of the Law; not onely as He is <hi>lex lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens</hi> himÅ¿elf, but becauÅ¿e he animateth the dead letter, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it active towards all his Subjects, <hi>premio &amp; poena.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. A wiÅ¿e King muÅ¿t do leÅ¿Å¿e in altering his Lawes, then he may, for new Government is ever dangerous, it being true in the Body Politick, as in the Corporall, that <hi>omnis Å¿ubditi imitatio est periculoÅ¿a;</hi> and though it be for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet it is not without a fearfull apprehenÅ¿ion; for hee that changeth the Fundamentall Laws of a Kingdome, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that there is no good Title to a Crown, but by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queÅ¿t.</p>
            <p n="10">10. A King that Å¿etteth to Å¿ale Seats of JuÅ¿tice, oppreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eth the People, for he teacheth his Judge to Å¿ell JuÅ¿tice, and <hi>precis parata precia vincitur justitia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. Bounty and magnificence are vertues very regall, but a prodigall King is neerer a Tyrant, then a Parcimonious; for Å¿tore at home draweth his Contemplations abroad, but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:161455:3"/>want Å¿upplyeth it felf of what is next, and many times the next way; and herein He muÅ¿t be wiÅ¿e, and know what He may juÅ¿tly do.</p>
            <p n="12">12. That King which is not Å¿eared, is not loved, and hee that is well Å¿een in his Craft, muÅ¿t as well Å¿tudy to be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as loved; yet, not loved for fear, but feared for love.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Therefore, as He muÅ¿t alwayes reÅ¿emble Him, whoÅ¿e great Name He beareth, and that in manifeÅ¿ting the Å¿weet influence of his mercy, over the Å¿evereÅ¿t Å¿troke of his juÅ¿t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ce Å¿ometimes, Å¿o in this, not to Å¿uffer a man of death to live; for beÅ¿ides, that the land doth mourn the reÅ¿traint of juÅ¿tice towards Å¿inne, doth more retard the affection of love, then the extent of mercy doth enflame it, and Å¿ure where love is beÅ¿towed, fear is quite loÅ¿t.</p>
            <p n="14">14 His greateÅ¿t enemies are his flatterers, for though they ever Å¿peak on his Å¿ide, yet their words Å¿till make againÅ¿t him.</p>
            <p>The love which a King oweth to the weal publike, Å¿hould not be reÅ¿trained to any one particular, yet that his more Å¿peciall favour do reflect upon Å¿ome worthy ones, is Å¿omewhat neceÅ¿Å¿ary, becauÅ¿e there are Å¿o few of that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie.</p>
            <p n="16">16 He muÅ¿t have a Å¿peciall care of five things, if he would not have his crown to be put upon him, <hi>Infelix fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitatis.</hi>

               <p>And if any Å¿uch Å¿ubordinate Judge Å¿hall obtaine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ion, according to the diÅ¿cretion of Å¿uch a Judge to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the People, that Judge is bound to think that to bee his Å¿ound diÅ¿cretion, which the law, in which the <hi>Kings</hi> known will Å¿heweth unto him to be that juÅ¿tice which he ought to adminiÅ¿ter; otherwiÅ¿e, he might Å¿eem to eÅ¿teem himÅ¿elfe above the Kings Law, who will not govern by him, or to have a power derived from other then from the King, which in the Kingdom will adminiÅ¿ter juÅ¿tice contrary unto the JuÅ¿tice of the Land; neither can Å¿uch a Judge or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿Å¿ioner, under the Name of his Authority, Å¿hroud his own high affection, Å¿eeing the ConÅ¿cience and diÅ¿cretion of every man is particular and private to himÅ¿elf, as the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Judge cannot be properly or poÅ¿Å¿ible the diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the ConÅ¿cience of the King, and if not his diÅ¿cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, neither the judgment that is ruled by another mans on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
